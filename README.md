WinRateCalculator
=================
For use with the video game World of Tanks (http://worldoftanks.com/).

This program calculates how many battles a player needs to reach a given win rate while playing at another given win rate.

Example, solves the question of: how many battles do I need to play at a win rate of 65% if I want to raise my current win rate from 55% to 60%.

The program requires an application_id from Wargaming. More information can be found here: https://na.wargaming.net/developers/applications/

Feel free to add feature and submit via pull request. This program may be added to a full suite of World of Tanks related command line tools at a later date.
